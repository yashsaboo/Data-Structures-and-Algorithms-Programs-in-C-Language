# Data Structures and Algorithms Programs in C Language
C is general-purpose, procedural computer programming language, which is usually the first language taught to an engineering student in an Indian engineering college. It wasn't my first programming language though, since I had started programming in Java during my school years. Data Structure is a fundamental requirement for any Computer Scientist.

## File Details
Codebase includes:
1. Data Structures: Queues (Linear Queue, Priority Queue, Double Ended Queue, Priority Queue using Circular Queue), Stacks(Linear Stack, MulitStack), LinkedLists( Singly, Doubly and Circular) and Trees (BinarySearch)
2. Algorithms: Josephus Problem, Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm, Sorting, Searching, Sparse Addition Algorithm, DFS, BFS
3. Miscellaneous: Dynamic Allocation, Expression Convertor, Matrix Operations, and Student Database							
					
## Requirements to run the code
GNU Compiler Collection
